# JavaScript-Calendar
A single-event calendar modal

In this project, you can use JavaScript to create a dynamic calendar filled with you or your user's unique events.
For each day, have the option to add one specific URL to a special event page for each designated event.

## Access this calendar by:
a) a modal popup (via Bootstrap or other)
b) implement it on your page live (by referencing the calendar id - ie. divCal)
